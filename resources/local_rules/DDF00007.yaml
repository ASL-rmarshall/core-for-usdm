Description: If timing type is "Fixed Reference" then it must point to only one scheduled
  instance (e.g. attribute relativeToScheduledInstance must be equal to relativeFromScheduledInstance
  or it must be missing).
Executability: Fully Executable
Outcome:
  Message: The Timing type is "Fixed Reference" but it does not point to only one
    scheduled instance - relativeToScheduledInstanceId is not missing and does not
    contain the same value as relativeFromScheduledInstanceId.
  Output Variables:
  - parent_entity
  - parent_id
  - parent_rel
  - id
  - name
  - type.decode
  - relativeFromScheduledInstanceId
